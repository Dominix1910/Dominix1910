## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dominik Scibor, I live in Manchester. 
I am keen to learn new skills and I always try to do my best at work.  
 Following the bootcamp at Just IT, I am looking for an entry-level data position to start this new exciting journey and develop myself to become a data analyst.
I am flexible at work, and I can adapt to unfamiliar environments quickly, so it is a benefit for employers in this dynamic work environment.
